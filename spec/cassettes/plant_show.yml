        plant species prefers moist, well-draining soil and should be watered at least
        once a week, preferably twice a week. Water deeply, ensuring the entire root
        zone has been adequately moistened. Water early in the day to avoid foliar

        periods of brief full afternoon sun, it is best to provide them with abundant
        morning sun and light afternoon shade for optimal growth and health."},{"id":5424,"type":"pruning","description":"Compact
        Hinoki Falsecypress should be pruned in late spring or early summer, when
        new growth has appeared. Start by removing any dead, diseased, or damaged
        branches to maintain a healthy plant. Next, cut back any overgrown branches
        to maintain a desired size and shape. You can also thin out dense inner foliage
        to promote better air circulation and allow sunlight to reach the inner foliage.
        Make sure to use sharp pruning shears, always cutting at a downward, outward
        angle, 1\/4 inch above a bud or branch fork. Avoid pruning too much at once,
        as over-pruning can damage the plant."}]}],"to":1,"per_page":30,"current_page":1,"from":1,"last_page":1,"total":1}'
