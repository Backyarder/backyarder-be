        can be done to encourage a desired shape or size. When pruning Tsuma Gaki
        Japanese Maple, it is important to only remove dead or damaged branches and

        Fullmoon Maple is an amazing ornamental tree that provides breathtaking visual
        impact throughout the year. Its young foliage emerges a bright pink hue in

        burnt orange in autumn. This spectacular show, combined with the graceful
        weeping branches and deep mahogany bark, makes it an ideal focal point in
        outdoor landscapes. Attaryi Fullmoon Maple is also known for its drought tolerance,
